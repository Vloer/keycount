0.4.7-beta changelog:
- You asked - I delivered! You can now export data to csv by typing /kcexport or click the button in the GUI
- Now storing deaths per character in party. This data is available retroactively
- Added ++ or +++ to dungeon timer if applicable
- Fixed bug where deaths were not being recorded correctly causing lua errors
- Fixed bug on setting 'stars' value in KeyCount.current. Caused dungeons to not be saved!
- Marking key as failed should no longer bug out (checking for partysize went wrong after a previous update)
